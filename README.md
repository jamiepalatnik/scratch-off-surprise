# Scratch-Off Surprise
#### Video Demo: Coming soon

## Introduction and overview
Inspired by the scratch-off minigames in the game Florence, I decided to create a scratch-off game web app that allows the player to touch or hover over an overlay to reveal a surprise picture underneath.

My 3-year-old daughter loves to play Florence with me, but there are only a few examples of this scratch-off effect in the game. I decided to create my own version to expand the concept to create many different surprise experiences. You can think of it as a game, where the main mechanics are territorial acquisition (more of the picture is revealed as you clear the overlay) and discovery (a sense of wonder and surprise). I am also inspired by the task to reveal the map in games like those in The Legend of Zelda series.

The game is available as a free web app.

## How to play instructions
1. Visit the site on desktop or mobile (mobile is best for little kids to play)
2. Touch or hover over the overlay to reveal the surprise image hidden underneath!
3. Choose a theme: animals, letters, or numbers.
4. Have fun!
