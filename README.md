# Scratch-Off Surprise
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:


##### Introduction and overview
Inspired by the scratch-off minigames in the game Florence, I decided to create a scratch-off game web app that allows the player to touch or click an overlay to reveal a picture underneath.

My 3-year-old daughter loves to play Florence with me, but there are only a few examples of this scratch-off effect in the game. I decided to create my own version to expand the concept to create many different surprise experiences. You can think of it as a game, where the main mechanics are territorial acquisition (more of the picture is revealed as you clear the overlay) and discovery (a sense of wonder and surprise). I am also inspired by the task to reveal the map in games like those in The Legend of Zelda series.

##### Planned - IN PROGRESS
Additional features include the ability to:
* Upload or choose an image
* Choose a theme (letters, numbers, animals, etc.) with random generation
* Check completion
* Choose overlay color or generate random color

The game is available as a free web app. iOS app coming soon.
