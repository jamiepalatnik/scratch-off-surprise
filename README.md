# Scratch-Off Surprise
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:


##### Introduction and overview
Inspired by the scratch-off minigames in the game Florence, I decided to create a scratch-off game web app that allows the player to touch or click an overlay to reveal a picture underneath.

My 3-year-old daughter loves to play Florence with me, but there are only a few examples of this scratch-off effect in the game. I decided to create my own version to expand the concept to create many different surprise experiences. You can think of it as a game, where the main mechanics are territorial acquisition (more of the picture is revealed as you clear the overlay) and discovery (a sense of wonder and surprise). I am also inspired by the task to reveal the map in games like those in The Legend of Zelda series.

##### Planned - IN PROGRESS
Additional features include the ability to:
* Upload or choose an image
* Choose a theme (letters, numbers, animals, etc.) with random generation
* Check completion
* Choose overlay color or generate random color

The game is available as a free web app.

##### How to play instructions
1. Visit the site on desktop or mobile (mobile is best for little kids to play)
2. Touch or hover over the overlay to reveal the surprise image hidden underneath!
