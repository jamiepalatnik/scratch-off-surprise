# CS50x Final Project Requirements

Last updated: 2024-11-13

## Overview
The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Codespace. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

See https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/project/ for details.

## Other Considerations
For your final project (and your final project only!) it is reasonable to use AI-based software other than CS50’s own (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bing Chat, et al.), but the essence of the work must still be your own. You’ve learned enough to use such tools as helpers. Treat such tools as amplifying, not supplanting, your productivity. But you still must cite any use of such tools in the comments of your code.

## Specification
* [x] Initial project setup
* [x] Research HTML canvas and JavaScript
* [x] Get the basic scratch-off effect working
* [ ] Make sure it fits to screen with no horizontal or vertical scroll
* [ ] Publish on GitHub Pages
* [ ] Add chunky buttons to reset and change picture, overlay, etc.
* [ ] Test on different screen sizes and devices

### Extra features to consider:
* [ ] Upload or choose an image
* [ ] Choose a theme (letters, numbers, animals, etc.) with random generation
* [ ] Check completion
* [ ] Choose overlay color or generate random color
* [ ] Add music
* [ ] Port it to an iOS app with Swift

## Questions/Issues

## Resolved
* How to learn from ChatGPT/tutorials while ensuring that "the essence of the work must still be your own"? Cite the use of code copied from tools in code comments.

## Updates Log
* 2024-11-13: Initial project setup and research, achieved working prototype

## Next Time
Walk through code line by line to make sure I understand EVERYTHING. This means looking up every method in documentation (MDN) and making sure I can understand it and possibly optimize it.

## Time Tracker
Started tracking my time with WakaTime. I'll report time tracked in my dashboard at the end of the project.
